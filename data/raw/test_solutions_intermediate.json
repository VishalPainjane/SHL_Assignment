Designed to measure a candidate\u2019s ability to listen attentively to the customer, take ownership of customer issues, resolve issues, navigate to find information, and enter information accurately, the Contact Center Simulation is intended to measure how a candidate will respond in a variety of customer situations and assess the candidate\u2019s computer skills in a contact center setting. The behavioral tests in this solution are intended to measure the candidate\u2019s learning potential and the tendency to meet goals and work hard, even when faced with obstacles. Collectively, the assessments in this solution measure a wide range of important skills, abilities, and behaviors for entry-level contact center roles.\n\"Please note that for Simplified Chinese version the audio is available in both Mandarin and Cantonese.\"",
