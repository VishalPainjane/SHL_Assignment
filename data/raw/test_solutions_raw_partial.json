Designed to measure a candidate\u2019s ability to listen attentively to the customer, take ownership of customer issues, resolve issues, navigate to find information, and enter information accurately, the Contact Center Simulation is intended to measure how a candidate will respond in a variety of customer situations and assess the candidate\u2019s computer skills in a contact center setting. The behavioral tests in this solution are intended to measure the candidate\u2019s learning potential and the tendency to meet goals and work hard, even when faced with obstacles. Collectively, the assessments in this solution measure a wide range of important skills, abilities, and behaviors for entry-level contact center roles.\n\"Please note that for Simplified Chinese version the audio is available in both Mandarin and Cantonese.\"",

The report text has been updated to reflect the inclusion of the OPQ, and the potential is also shown in the competency summary part of the report. The OPQ scores that feed into this report will need to be uploaded into MFS using an upload sheet based on a score extract from SODA or TC. This particular example report also includes development tips which are an optional extra.",

    "description": "The PJM Report provides a clear indication of each candidate's \"degree of fit\" to a role. Provides targeted assessment results that match individuals with jobs . Links the essential/desirable competencies for a specific job with an individual\u2019s competency potential. Provides an overall Match (or fit) Score useful in ranking/sorting candidates for selection and/or development (e.g. Talent Audit). It provides a highly visual profile of a candidate's strengths and limitations against identified required competencies. Includes a summary table that enables prioritisation of action planning for development of critical competencies for an individual (by tabling Competency Potential against Job Importance for the role). It includes highly descriptive statements about a candidate's strengths and development needs/limitations. The extended report versions include proposed competency-based interview questions to enable probing of specific situations in which the candidate might have demonstrated critical job behaviours. The PJM Report is designed for use by line managers and HR professionals in selection and development situations. It is valuable for identifying an individual's overall fit as well as likely areas of strength and weakness relative to their behaviour at work. In a selection context, this information can be used: For making interviewers aware of the areas that may need further probing. As a basis for suggesting and creating relevant interview questions. For identifying the relative strengths and weaknesses of shortlisted candidates.",

    "description": "The Reading Comprehension - English assessment provides a general measure of English reading comprehension. This test is comprised of items that contain a passage that you must read in order to answer the question being asked. The questions focus on the candidate's ability to demonstrate an understanding of the passage. Questions may be specific in nature, with answers that can be found almost word for word in the passage. For example, the question may ask for a date, name or place that can be found by closely reading through the passage. Alternatively, the questions may be general in nature, with answers that can be determined only by fully understanding the meaning of the passage. \"What is the theme of the passage?\" or \"What is the mood of the author?\" are examples of general questions the candidate may be asked.",

By offering a wide range of perspectives, 360 feedback gives employees a more thorough understanding of not only their strengths, weaknesses, and development opportunities, but also their impact on others. 360-degree multi-rater assessments are based on SHL\u2019s Universal Competency Framework (\u201cUCF\u201d), using our proven library of research-driven competencies to provide opportunities for managers, peers, and direct reports to supply useful developmental feedback that they may not otherwise share. SHL can also offer support and training throughout the entire process, from defining objectives through interpreting and delivering the feedback. 360 feedback serves all levels and industries and is a positive and powerful addition to your performance management system.",
